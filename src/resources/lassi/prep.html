<li><strong>Yogurt</strong>: Highly recommend using full-fat yogurt to get a rich, thick and creamy texture. But considering fat intake, you can use low-fat or fat-free yogurt.</li>



<li><strong>Black salt (kala namak)</strong>: It adds a nice zing and flavor to the drink.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Roasted cumin powder:</strong> here’s how to make it at home - Dry roast the cumin seeds on medium-low heat with stirring constantly until aromatic and dark in color. Once cools down grind into a powder using a spice grinder (or mortar and pestle if making a small quantity). You can keep this in the air-tight container for up to 2-3 months.</li>
